        Script to copy files using 'rsync' and cancel the process on error.

    Details

        When 'rsync' encounters errors such as an I/O error, it proceeds with
        the next file to copy. That's not unexpected behavior though, but in
        some cases it would be nice if the 'rsync' process would be canceled
        instead.

        Notice that this script is just a quick-and-dirty solution and not
        intended for everyday use. There is a lot of room for improvement in
        this tool.

        For example, the given command-line arguments do not get validated,
        they will simply be passed to the 'rsync' command and no additional
        arguments can be added to the 'rsync' command.

        Furthermore, using 'inotifywait' or something like that would also
        make sense and be an improvement. This would avoid the manual check of
        the log file every second.

        Feel free to modify!

    Notice

        This project was officially discontinued as of August 2025 and is no
        longer maintained.

    Usage

        The script only expects two command-line arguments, a source and a
        destination path:

            $ ./rsbreak.sh SOURCE DESTINATION
